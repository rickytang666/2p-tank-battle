## üìù Description

### Intro of rules

Players start with 100 live points, each tries to use the keyboard to attack the other tank to make it die (run out of live points). 

Fuel is necessary for the tanks to move/attack, while a basic fuel capacity is 10000 mL. Every second in the game the tank consumes 1 mL, every pixel moving the tank consumes 1 mL, and every time it attacks (whether successful or not) the tank consumes 30 mL.

The tanks have limited shoot range and any attack towards a target out of the shoot range is never successful. The basic shoot range is approximately 1/5 of the screen's diagonal length.

A basic tank has 35 ammunition at the beginning of the game.

Every successful attack would reduce the opponent's live points, the basic hurt is 6 live points per hit. However, when colliding with the walls or the opponent, the tank would reduce live points every 1.5 seconds upon the collision.

### Game Special Techniques

- #### Long Shooter 

  - 1.5x the basic shoot range

- #### Furious Shooter

- #### Auto Aiming

  - You don't have to rotate to aim the opponent (The tank automatically does it)
  - But only 0.7x the basic shoot range, and only half speed and fuel

- #### Resource God

  - 15 more ammunition

- #### Juggernaut

  - Only 2/3 of hurt when being hit
  - Only half speed and half fuel capacity

- #### Sport Champion

  - 1.5x the basic fuel and speed, and twice the normal rotation speed

- #### Self Heal

  - Gain 1 live point every 150 pixels the tank moves

- #### Gatlin

  - Twice the normal shooting frequency

### Technologies Used

- **Coding Language**: Python (**Tkinter** Package)
- **Development Platform**: Microsoft Visual Studio Code & CodeHS
- **Source Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Markdown File Editing**: Typora


### Future Improvements

- Add **tutorial mode** for new players to get familiar with the controls and special techniques, to make the game more accessible
- **Customizable Tanks**: Allowing players to customize their tanks (colors, designs, etc.)
- **Leaderboards**: Using a file interaction to store the win/loss numbers, hurt points in total matches, etc.
- **Terrain and Weather Effects:** Incorporate different terrains (like mud can increase the friction, and fog can reduce the shooting range), to make the game more interesting
- **Add a maze map**: Make the game into a maze to let the players hide and dodge
